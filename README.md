The site of zhdk.ch shares a universal layout in all pages, which the page layout only depends on its content type. Therefore I only created four pages for preview. They are:

* [Homepage](https://clone-zhdk.vercel.app/)
* [Studium](https://clone-zhdk.vercel.app/studium)
* [Weiterbildung](https://clone-zhdk.vercel.app/weiterbildung)
* [Jahresbericht 2020](https://clone-zhdk.vercel.app/annual-report)

The other pages should be rendered properly if feed the page data, except the special content type I didn't contain in the code.
